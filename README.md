# Bare a SASS based Magento 2 theme

This Theme is not yet ready for production.

What was changed from the Blank Theme (1.0.2)

* Box-Sizing is now globally set to Border-Box, we also removed all the Box-Sizing 
* Removed the wide arrange of color variables and exchanged them with deafult color states
* Moved the Variables out of the modules into a variable folder to have  better overview
* Swatches are now based on variables and not fixed colors
* Fixed a couple of issues with the Navigation Styles, Borders, positions, not working submenu marks and some blinking
* Overhauled and dumped down the message variables, removed the ateral variant 
+ And other stuff I totally forgot to write down...
